Assuming you have a SilverStripe 2.4 installation set up already:

 * Put a copy of the eCommerce code into your site directory. The directory must be called 'ecommerce' for some links to work properly.
 * Also get a copy of the [http://silverstripe.org/payment-module/ Payment module], this is a requirement of eCommerce. Make sure you get the right version of the Payment Module - currently this is /branches/0.3
 * Run mysite/db/build?flush=1
