## Member functionality

If a member is logged in when they place an order, that order will be associated with their account.
The rest of the time they may log in / out and the order will remain associated with the session.

Config settings:

	OrderForm::set_user_membership_optional(true); //allow/deny users the choice to become a member
	OrderForm::set_force_membership(false);
	
The way for a user to specify they don't want to become a member is by leaving the password fields blank on the checkout page.
Usability could be further improved by adding a checkbox with the question "do you want to save your details?", which would show the password fields via ajax only when the user checks the box.
