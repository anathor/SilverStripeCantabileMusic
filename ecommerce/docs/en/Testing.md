Testing the eCommerce Module
============================
Testing is highly important for maintaining a quality product.

Regression Testing
------------------
This [Google doc containing regression tests](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AtHUrSaBxJY8dG8teWVNTFYzbThZYUhhLTNmT0FiUHc&hl=en) will give you an idea of the various things you can test manually.
In a nutshell, be sure to test the following main functionality:

 * Adding/removing items from cart
 * Placing an order

Unit Testing
------------
We insist that the eCommerce module contains a suite of unit tests that are updated with any changes to the code. Sub-Modules should also have their own test suites.
See the [sapphire testing documentation](http://doc.silverstripe.org/sapphire/en/topics/testing/index) for setup information etc.

To run all ecommerce tests visit yoursite/dev/ecommerce and click the "Run all ecommerce unit tests" link.

**Note:** Be aware that your configuration in _config.php may affect your test results.
